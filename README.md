## About Us

#### Padmapriya Ganapathi

Originally from India, I have been a Pacific Northwest native for almost 13 years now. I have held suport and project management roles before and currently transitioning into a software developer role. When I am not working, I am usually spending some quality time with my family or volunteering in one of my kid's classes.

#### Manish KC

An army vet and aspiring PNW, I call Washington my home. I completed my Masters in Computer Science from University of Washington and currently pursuing my career as an SDE at Amazon. If I am not doing anything, I get found either lost on the woods or watching some fantasy sci-fi on netflix.

#### Renee Messick

Though born and raised in the Bay Area, I've found my home in Seattle. I'm a software developer in training, interested in creating a user-centric approach to design and development. When not coding I'm spending time with my tiny monster dog and binge watching tv shows.

#### Nicholas Paro

I was born and raised in Vermont, received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Music Theory and Composition from Carnegie Mellon Unversity, an Army Veteran, a Computer Science undergrad at Southern New Hampshire University, and now a software developer. I am interested in creating customer centric applications which help change someone's life for the better. When not working, I spend my time with my family and continuing to learn to concepts and technologies.

## Conflict Resolution Plan

- What will our group do when it encounters conflict?

  - As a group we will put any conflicting idea to a vote.
    - One person will be randomly selected each dat (changes every day) to have a double vote. This will ensure all ties are broken.
    - If the vote is unable to solve the issue, we will move into a Conflict Resolution Circle.

- How will you raise concerns to members who are not adiquately contributing?

  - We will address our concerns in our end-of-day standup. This will ensure all concerns are voiced without instructor involvement.
  - Concerns will be raised in the beginning-of-dat standup if the same issue becomes necessary to express to the instructor team.
  - We will start all conflict problems from a place of support and we will express our intentions with a whole message - this will help to reduce unnessecary friction if a conflict arises.
  - We will attempt to only use "I" statements when approaching a conflict.

- What is your process to resolve conflicts?

  - We will ensure all members are fed and sufficiently watered.
  - We will allow members to take reasonably timed breaks.
  - We will create a safe space where everyone is able to be heard, valued, and respected.

- How and when will you escalate the conflict resolution?
  - If we are unable to solve our through a vote we will escalete to a Conflict Resolution Circle. If a circle is called we will all:
    - close our laptops.
    - use a "talking stick" to ensure all concerns are aired and expressed.
    - continue to follow all rules layed down previously to ensure ONLY appropriate and constructive comments are made.
    - when circle ends, the issue is CLOSED and the resolution is complete.
  - If the Conflict Resolution Circle is unable to solve the issue, or the issue persists passed a Conflict Resolution Circle, we will bring the issue to Nicholas.

## Conflict Resolution Plan
* What will our group do when it encounters conflict?
  * As a group we will put any conflicting idea to a vote.
    * One person will be randomly selected each dat (changes every day) to have a double vote. This will ensure all ties are broken.
    * If the vote is unable to solve the issue, we will move into a Conflict Resolution Circle.

* How will you raise concerns to members who are not adiquately contributing?
  * We will address our concerns in our end-of-day standup. This will ensure all concerns are voiced without instructor involvement.
  * Concerns will be raised in the beginning-of-dat standup if the same issue becomes necessary to express to the instructor team.
  * We will start all conflict problems from a place of support and we will express our intentions with a whole message - this will help to reduce unnessecary friction if a conflict arises.
  * We will attempt to only use "I" statements when approaching a conflict.

* What is your process to resolve conflicts?
  * We will ensure all members are fed and sufficiently watered.
  * We will allow members to take reasonably timed breaks.
  * We will create a safe space where everyone is able to be heard, valued, and respected.

* How and when will you escalate the conflict resolution?
  * If we are unable to solve our through a vote we will escalete to a Conflict Resolution Circle. If a circle is called we will all:
    * close our laptops.
    * use a "talking stick" to ensure all concerns are aired and expressed.
    * continue to follow all rules layed down previously to ensure ONLY appropriate and constructive comments are made.
    * when circle ends, the issue is CLOSED and the resolution is complete.
  * If the Conflict Resolution Circle is unable to solve the issue, or the issue persists passed a Conflict Resolution Circle, we will bring the issue to Nicholas.
